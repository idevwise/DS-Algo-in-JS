# DS-Algo-in-JS

This repository collects a few data structure and algorithm examples written in JavaScript. The project uses Node.js with ES modules and includes all required packages in the `node_modules` directory.

## Folder overview

- **DataStructures/** – implementations for linked lists, hash tables and more.
- **Graphs/** – graph related algorithms (for example breadth first search).
- **Searching/** – search algorithms such as binary search.
- **Sorting/** – sorting algorithms like quick sort and merge sort.
- **Problems/** – assorted example problems.
- **node_modules/** – npm dependencies that come bundled with the repository.
- `util.js` – small utility functions used by examples.

## Running examples

Each JavaScript file can be executed directly with Node.js. Use `node FILE.js` and provide the relative path to the script you want to run. For instance:

```bash
node Sorting/quickSort.js
```

Run any other script in the same manner to see its output.
